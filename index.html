  <h1> HOBBIES AND INTRESTS </h1>
  <BODY> 
    <h1> CONCERTS </h1>
    <h6> I've seen variety of artist including: KESHI, JOJI, And many more </h6>
    <p> I've had the chance to see a few artis in my life. Many of them have been a surprise or last minute plans. 
    Getting to enjoy live music and hear other people appreciate the songs you do is a great feeling. Bring in the pit
    is one of the best parts of a concert. Standing can be uncomfortable at times but you only live once.</p>
    <h1> Floral Arrangements </h1>
    <h6> A few of favorite flowers are Lilies, Roses, Chrysanthemum, and Bleeding Heart!</h6>
    <P> When I was in High School I took a floral arrangement class. This was my first ever FFA class and one of the only 
      electives I got to take in High School. Here I learned how to open flowers correctly, care for them, make simple 
      arrangements, and even competed in a competition for the school. I've made many arrangements for loved ones. Flowers
      are always a simple gift many people appreciate, but also many forget to buy. Making arrangements have become a simple
      A hobby of mine. It's peaceful and seeing the face of the person who receives them is always the best.</P>
    <h1> Cooking </h1>
    <h6> I love to cook Italian  food </h6>
    <p> I know how to cook for my roommates and friends! I truly do enjoy to cook and whip something up for them. I use 
      that time to just ignore all the stress in my life and just cook. Nothing beats the smell of fresh herbs, butter, and
      garlic. It can be scary to cook at times like frying but the taste of homemade food never beats anything else in the world. 
      I love to cook because I'm good at it but also watching other people's reactions. You wouldn't be surprised by the amount 
      of people who don't know how to cook and when they finally get a good meal in college their eyes just light up.  </p>
